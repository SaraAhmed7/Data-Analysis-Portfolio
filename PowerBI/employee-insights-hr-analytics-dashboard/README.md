# Employee Insights & HR Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“– Project Story  
This Power BI project analyzes employee, department, job, and location data to provide meaningful insights for HR and management decision-making.  

The dataset integrates multiple sources (Employees, Departments, Jobs, Locations, Countries) to give a **360Â° view of the workforce** â€” covering salaries, hiring, job roles, and global distribution.  

The main goal is to help:  
- HR managers monitor employee distribution across departments and countries.  
- Executives evaluate salary structures compared to job ranges.  
- Business leaders understand workforce demographics and identify areas for optimization.
