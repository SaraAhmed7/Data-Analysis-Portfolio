# Web Scraping  

This folder contains a simple example of **web scraping** using Python.  
The goal is to practice extracting data from websites and saving it in a structured format for analysis.  

### Contents:
- `booksWebScraping.py` → Python script for scraping data.  
- `books_result_scrapping.csv` → Sample output file containing the scraped data.  

### Tools & Libraries:
- `requests`  
- `BeautifulSoup`  
- `pandas`  

### Notes:
- This is just a **practice example**, not a production project.
- The target website is a demo site, not a real online store.
